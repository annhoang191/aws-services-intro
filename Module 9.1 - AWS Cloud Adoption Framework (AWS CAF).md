# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
- Migrating to the cloud is a process.
- The AWS professional services team has created something called the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework that can help you manage this process through guidance. 
- The Cloud Adoption Framework exists to provide advice to your company to enable a quick and smooth migration to AWS.
- The framework organizes guidance into six areas focused on the different types of people that you'll need to involve for your migration.
- Each Perspective covers distinct responsibilities covered by different groups. The different Perspectives are Business, People, and Governance Perspectives, which focus on the business capabilities, and then you have the Platform, Security and Operations Perspectives which focus on the technical capabilities.
