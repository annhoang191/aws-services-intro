# Amazon DynamoDB

## Nonrelational databases
- In a **nonrelational database**, you create tables. A table is a place where you can store and query data.
- Are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data.
- One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs.
- With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values).
- In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time.
- Not every item in the table has to have the same attributes.

## Amazon DynamoDB
- Is a key-value database service.
- It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
- **Serverless**: you do not have to provision, patch, manage servers, install, maintain, or operate software.
- **Automatic Scaling**: As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB **automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity** while maintaining consistent performance.

=> A suitable choice for use cases that require **high performance while scaling.**
