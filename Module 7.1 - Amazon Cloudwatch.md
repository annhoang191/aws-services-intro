# Amazon Cloudwatch
- Is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.
- It uses [**metrics**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) to represent the data points for your resources.
- AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.

## Cloudwatch alarms
- You can create [**alarms**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold.
-  When configuring the alarm, you can specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.
#### Example
Your companyâ€™s developers use Amazon EC2 instances for application development or testing purposes. If the developers occasionally forget to stop the instances, the instances will continue to run and incur charges.
=> you could create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain threshold for a specified period

## Cloudwatch dashboard
- The CloudWatch [**dashboard**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location.
- You can use a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU utilization of an Amazon EC2 instance, the total number of requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, and more. 
- You can even customize separate dashboards for different business purposes, applications, or resources.
