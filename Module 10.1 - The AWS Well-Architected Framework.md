# The AWS Well-Architected Framework
- The [**AWS Well-Architected Framework**](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf) helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. 
- It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.
- The Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars:
	- Operational excellence
	- Security
	- Reliability
	- Performance efficiency
	- Cost optimization

## Operational excellence
- Is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  
- Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include **performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.**

## Security
- Is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
- When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:
	- Automate security best practices when possible.
	- Apply security at all layers.
	- Protect data in transit and at rest.

## Reliability
- Is the ability of a system to do the following:
	- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
	- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
	- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- Reliability includes **testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.**

## Performance efficiency
- Is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 
- Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes **experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.**

## Cost optimization
- Is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 
- Cost optimization includes **adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.**
