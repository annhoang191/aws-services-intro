# Consolidate Billing
- AWS Organizations also provides the option for [**consolidated billing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html).
- It enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization.
- By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization.
- The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.
- On your monthly bill, you can review itemized charges incurred by each account. This enables you to have greater transparency into your organizationâ€™s accounts while still maintaining the convenience of receiving a single monthly bill.
- It can share bulk discount pricing, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in your organization.
	- Example: one account might not have enough monthly usage to qualify for discount pricing. However, when multiple accounts are combined, their aggregated usage may result in a benefit that applies across all accounts in the organization.
