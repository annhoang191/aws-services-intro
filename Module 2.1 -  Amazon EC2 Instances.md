# Amazon EC2 
## Instance types
- EC2 are optimized for different tasks. When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications.
=> This might include requirements for compute, memory, storage capabilities.

### General purpose instances
- Provide balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. Can use for these workloads: 
	- Application servers
	- Gaming servers
	- Backend servers for enterprise applications
	- Small and medium databases
#### Example
An app in which the resource needs for compute, memory, and networking are roughly equivalent because the app does not require optimization in any single resource area.

### Compute optimized instances
- Ideal for compute-bound apps that benefit from high-performance processors.
- Can use for those workloads like general purpose instances. 
- The different is compute optimized apps are ideal for high-performance web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers.
- Also use for batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.

### Memory optimized instances
- Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large dataset in memory.
- Memory: a temporary storage area holding all the data and instructions that are CPU needs to be able to complete actions.
- Before a computer program or app is able to run, it is loaded from storage into memory. This preloading process gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.
- Memory optimized instances enable you to run workload with high memory needs and receive great performance
#### Example
You have a workload that requires large amount of data to be preloaded before running an app. This might be a high-performance database or a workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data.

### Accelerated computing instances
- Use hardward accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.
- Example of these functions: floating-point numbers calculations, graphic processing, data patternmatching
- Hardware accelerator: a component that can expedite data processing. Accelerated computing instances are ideal for workloads such as graphic apps, game streaming, application streaming.

### Storage optimized instances
- Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.
- Use for these kinds of workloads:
	- Distributed file systems
	- Data warehousing applications
	- High-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) system 
- Input/output operations per second (IOPS): a metric that measures the performance of a storage device. It indicates how many different input or output operations a device can perform in one second.
- Storage optimized instances are designed to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to apps.
- Input operations: data put into a system, such as records entered into a database.
- Output operations: data generated by a server. It might be the analytics performed on the records in a database
#### Example
If you have an application that has a high IOPS requirement, a storage optimized instance can provide better performance over other instance types not optimized for this kind of use case.
