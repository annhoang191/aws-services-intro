# Benefit of AWS Cloud
Operating in the AWS Cloud offers many benefits over computing in on-premises or hybrid environments. There are 6 advantages.

- Trade upfront expense for variable exepense
	- Upfront expense: data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them.
	- Variable expense: only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them.
=> Companies can implement innovation solutions while saving on costs
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
	- Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infra and servers
=> Cloud computing can help you focus less on these tasks and more on your apps and customers
- Stop guessing capacity 
	- No need to predict how much infra capacity you will need before deploying an app
=> You can launch an EC2 instance when needed and pay only for the the compute time you use. Instead of paying unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
	- You can achieve lower variable cost than you can get on your own
	- The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices
- Increase speed and agility
	- This flexibility gives you more time to experiment and innovate.
	- When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparision, cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes
- Go global in minutes
	- The global footprint of aws enables you to deploy apps to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
=> If you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays
